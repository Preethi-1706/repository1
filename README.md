## Introduction

The Signal Detection System is a Java-based application that processes input data (such as images, videos, or sensor readings) to detect various types of signals. The system can be used in applications like **traffic signal detection**, **gesture recognition**, or **signal pattern analysis**. The project uses machine learning and/or image processing techniques to analyze data and make real-time predictions or classifications.

### Key Features:

- **Signal Detection**: Detects and classifies signals from real-time video feeds or sensor data.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes input data in real-time for immediate feedback or actions.
- **Flexible Signal Types**: Supports multiple types of signal detection, including traffic lights, hand gestures, or other signal types.
- **Integration with Sensors**: Can be integrated with hardware sensors (e.g., cameras, infrared sensors) for real-world applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses machine learning models to improve signal detection accuracy.

## Features

- **Signal Recognition**: Detects specific signals like traffic lights, stop signs, or hand gestures.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The system provides real-time feedback about detected signals, which can trigger predefined actions.
- **Image/Video Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV or similar libraries for processing image data from cameras or video files.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Optionally integrates with pre-trained machine learning models for more accurate signal classification.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows users to adjust the sensitivity and detection parameters based on the use case (e.g., traffic density, distance from the camera).

## Installation

To run the Signal Detection System on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or higher** (JDK)
- **Apache Maven** or **Gradle** (for dependency management and building the project)
- **OpenCV** or another image-processing library (if you're using image/video processing)
- **Optional: Machine Learning Libraries** (if applicable, such as TensorFlow or Weka for Java)

### Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/signal-detection.git
